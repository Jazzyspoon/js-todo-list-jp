# js-todo-list-jp
Created via an online tutorial given by Max Sandelin on youtube that step by step.
It took around 8 hours to finish with Max (who is amazing, btw) on .5 speed on youtube.  
I couldn't get it to work, even after reviewing his code on Github line by line, until I realized he had updated his reset.min.css file.
I am, over time, going to tweak the look via css, but for now this resembles his pretty much verbatim.
The tutorial can be found on Github here:  https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo
